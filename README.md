## Credits
  Thanks to Trilogy Education Services for inspiring me to create this portfolio and FreeCodeCamp.org for an awesome advanced animation tutorial. Also wanted to highlight Abbey Perini that wrote an article about How to Toggle Dark Mode in React. It helped me a lot with implementation of switching theme functionality.
